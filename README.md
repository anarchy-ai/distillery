## üíÅ What is the Distillery? üíÅ

If your doing one thing lots of times, why use a giant expensive and slow general purpose model when a fine-tuned small model could suffice?
Where do you get the training data? 
Why not from running a big model on user data?  
What if you don't have enough user data? 
Synthesize some with the big model.

Distillery does this.  Replace `openai.complete` or whatever with `distillery.complete` and it will 
help you automatically switch over to a custom fine-tuned model.

## üöÄ Quickstart üöÄ

### ü•π Requirements

#### Installation Requirements

Python >=3.10 Supported. Older versions of Python are on a best-effort basis. 

Use ```bash > python3 --version ``` to check what version you are on. 

To upgrade your python, either create a new python env using ```bash > conda create -n myenv python=3.10 ``` or go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download the latest version.

### üë®‚Äçüíª Installation

The quickest way to get started is to run `pip install llm-vm` in your Python environment. 

Alternatively you could do this:

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/anarchy-ai/distillery.git
> cd distillery
> python -m venv <name>
> source <name>/bin/activate
> python -m pip install -e ."[dev]"
```


### ‚úÖ Usage

```python
# import our client
from distillery.client import Client

# Select which LLM you want to use, here we have OpenAI 
client = Client(big_model = 'chat_gpt')

# Put in your prompt and go!
response = client.complete(system_prompt = '', prompt = 'What is Anarchy?', openai_key = 'ENTER_YOUR_API_KEY')
print(response)
# Anarchy is a political ideology that advocates for the absence of government...
```
